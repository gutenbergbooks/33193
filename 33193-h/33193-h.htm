<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In publishing this poem, the Author feels that some apology is needed. It
deals with matters of a kind not usually treated in modern verse, and
which ask to be approached, if at all, with dignity and reverence. He
trusts that he will not be found lacking on this essential point.
Nevertheless, he cannot expect but that he may wound by his plain speaking
the feelings of those among his readers who sincerely believe that
Nineteenth Century Civilisation is synonymous with Christianity, and that
the English Race, above all those in existence, has a special mission from
Heaven to subdue and occupy the Earth. The self-complacency of the
Author&#8217;s countrymen on this head is too deeply seated to be attacked
without offence. He has not, however, shrunk from so attacking, and from
insisting on the truth that the hypocrisy and all-acquiring greed of
modern England is an atrocious spectacle&mdash;one which, if there be any
justice in Heaven, must bring a curse from God, as it has surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> already
made the angels weep. The destruction of beauty in the name of science,
the destruction of happiness in the name of progress, the destruction of
reverence in the name of religion, these are the pharisaic crimes of all
the white races; but there is something in the Anglo-Saxon impiety
crueller still: that it also destroys, as no other race does, for its mere
vain-glorious pleasure. The Anglo-Saxon alone has in our day exterminated,
root and branch, whole tribes of mankind. He alone has depopulated
continents, species after species, of their wonderful animal life, and is
still yearly destroying; and this not merely to occupy the land, for it
lies in large part empty, but for his insatiable lust of violent
adventure, to make record bags and kill. That things are so is ample
reason for the hardest words the Author can command.</p>

<p>To his fellow poets and poetic critics the Author too would say a word. He
has chosen as the vehicle of his thought a metre to which in English they
are unaccustomed, the six-foot Alexandrine couplet. For some reason which
the Author has never understood, this, the classic metre in France, has
stood in disrepute with us. Yet he ventures to think that, for rhetorical
and dramatic purposes, it is infinitely preferable to our own heroic
couplet, and preferable even, in any hands but the strongest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> to our
traditional blank verse. He believes, moreover, that if our skilled
dramatists would make trial of it, it would, by its extreme flexibility
and the natural break of its cesura, enable them to capture that shyest of
all shy things&mdash;success in a rhymed modern play. At least, he trusts that
they will give it their consideration, and not condemn him off-hand
because, having a rhetorical subject to deal with, he has treated it
rhetorically and in what he considers the best rhetoric form, though both
rhetoric and Alexandrines are out of fashion.</p>

<p>Lastly, he has to discharge, in connection with his poem, a double debt of
gratitude. The poem, unworthy as it is, is, by permission, dedicated to
the first of living thinkers, Mr. Herbert Spencer. To his reasoned and
life-long advocacy of the rights of the weak in Man&#8217;s higher evolution is
due all that in the poem is intellectually worthiest, to this and to the
inspiration of much personal encouragement and sympathy received by the
Author at a moment of public excitement when it was onerous yet necessary
for the Author to speak unpopular truths.</p>

<p>To Mr. Spencer&#8217;s great name the Author would add the name of that other
senior of the ideal world, Mr. George Frederick Watts, the first of living
painters, with whom, while the poem was in progress, it was his privilege
to spend many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> emotional hours in high communings on Life and Death and
the tragic Beauty of the world. He would thank him publicly here for the
leave generously given him to add to the volume its chief ornament, the
frontispiece, which is a reproduction of Mr. Watts&#8217; Angel of Pity weeping
over the dead birds&#8217; wings.</p>

<p>To both these heroic workers in the cause of good the Author in gratitude
inscribes himself their faithful servant, disciple, and friend.</p>

<tr><td>To-day is the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;day.&#8221; Once more on His good pleasure<br />
I, the Heresiarch, wait and pace these halls at leisure<br />
Among the Orthodox, the unfallen Sons of God.<br />
How sweet in truth Heaven is, its floors of sandal wood,<br />
Its old-world furniture, its linen long in press,<br />
Its incense, mummeries, flowers, its scent of holiness!<br />
Each house has its own smell. The smell of Heaven to me<br />
Intoxicates and haunts&mdash;and hurts. Who would not be<br />
God&#8217;s liveried servant here, the slave of His behest,<br />
Rather than reign outside? I like good things the best,<br />
Fair things, things innocent; and gladly, if He willed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Would enter His Saints&#8217; kingdom&mdash;even as a little child (<i>laughs</i>).<br />
I have come to make my peace, to crave a full &#8220;amaun,&#8221;<br />
Peace, pardon, reconcilement, truce to our daggers-drawn,<br />
Which have so long distraught the fair wise Universe,<br />
An end to my rebellion and the mortal curse<br />
Of always evil-doing. He will mayhap agree<br />
I was less wholly wrong about Humanity<br />
The day I dared to warn His wisdom of that flaw.<br />
It was at least the truth, the whole truth I foresaw<br />
When he must needs create that simian &#8220;in His own<br />
Image and likeness.&#8221; Faugh! the unseemly carrion!<br />
I claim a new revision and with proofs in hand,<br />
No Job now in my path to foil me and withstand.<br />
Oh, I will serve Him well!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">(<i>Certain Angels approach</i>). But who are these that come</span><br />
With their grieved faces pale and eyes of martyrdom?<br />
Not our good Sons of God? They stop, gesticulate,<br />
Argue apart, some weep,&mdash;weep, here within Heaven&#8217;s gate!<br />
Sob almost in God&#8217;s sight! ay, real salt human tears,<br />
Such as no Spirit wept these thrice three thousand years.<br />
The last shed were my own, that night of reprobation<br />
When I unsheathed my sword and headed the lost nation.<br />
Since then not one of them has spoken above his breath<br />
Or whispered in these courts one word of life or death<br />
Displeasing to the Lord. No Seraph of them all,<br />
Save I this day each year, has dared to cross Heaven&#8217;s hall<br />
And give voice to ill news, an unwelcome truth to Him.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>Not Michael&#8217;s self hath dared, prince of the Seraphim.<br />

Before Thee in Thy dreams. Thou deemedst to endow<br />

It grieved Thee the Stars knew not. Thou couldst not cajole<br />
Their music into tears, their beauty to full praise.<br />
Thou askedst one made conscious of Thy works and ways,<br />
One dowered with sense and passion, which should feel and move<br />
And weep with Thee and laugh, one that alas, should love.<br />
Thus didst thou mould the Earth. We Spirits, wondering, eyed<br />
Thy new-born fleshly things, Thy Matter deified.<br />
We saw the sea take life, its myriad forms all fair.<br />
We saw the creeping things, the dragons of the air,<br />
The birds, the four-foot beasts, all beautiful, all strong,<br />
All brimming o&#8217;er with joyaunce, new green woods among,<br />
Twice glorious in their lives. And we, who were but spirit,<br />
Envied their lusty lot, their duplicated merit,<br />
Their feet, their eyes, their wings, their physical desires,<br />

Which lit their sentient limbs and joined them heart to heart,<br />
Their power to act, to feel, all that corporeal part<br />
Which is the truth of love and giveth the breathing thing<br />

And calledst him, in scorn of all that brave parade,<br />
King of Thy living things, in Thine own likeness made!<br />

The spear wound in His side. He had come to comfort them,<br />
Confirm them in the faith, by His love&#8217;s stratagem.<br />
How if this thing were real: If this, that proved Him God,<br />
Proved also themselves spirits, not mere flesh and blood<br />
One with the beasts that perish, but immortal souls,<br />
Even as we angels are who fill Heaven&#8217;s muster rolls<br />
And so shall live for aye? &#8220;Here,&#8221; argued they, &#8220;it stands<br />
&#8220;The kingdom of His Heaven, a house not made with hands,<br />
&#8220;Wherein we too new-born, but in no earthly case,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&#8220;Shall enter after death.&#8221; On this fair fragile base<br />
Their sorrow built its nest. It gave a hope to men<br />
And pandered to their pride. And lo the world&#8217;s disdain<br />
Was changed to acclamation. Kings and emperors kneeled<br />
Before the Crucified, a living God revealed,<br />
Who made them heirs with Him of His own glory. Mark<br />
The ennobling phrase and title. No base Noah&#8217;s ark<br />
Man&#8217;s fount of honour now, but God&#8217;s eternal choice<br />
Made of His human race, predestined to His joys<br />
From the first dawn of time,&mdash;the very Universe<br />
Resolved to a mere potsherd, shattered to rehearse<br />
The splendour of Man&#8217;s advent, the one act and end<br />
To which Creation moved, and where even we must tend,<br />
The spirit hosts of Heaven&mdash;Stark mad insolence!<br />
Rank blasphemy proclaimed in Rome&#8217;s halls and Byzance,<br />
Through all the Imperial lands, as though, forsooth, Thou, Lord,<br />
Couldst, even if Thou wouldst, raise this fantastic horde<br />
Of bodies to Thy glory, shapes dispersed and gone<br />
As lightly as Time&#8217;s wracks swept to oblivion!<br />
Yet all believed this creed. Space, straightway grown too strait,<br />
Shrank from these Christened kings, who held Earth reprobate<br />
Save for their own high calling. Heaven had become their throne,<br />
A fief for their new pride, in which they reigned alone,<br />
In virtue of their faith, above Time&#8217;s humbler show,<br />
And Earth became their footstool. All were masters now<br />
Of the brute beasts despised who had no souls to save,<br />
And lords too of the heathen doomed beyond the grave.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>God&#8217;s kingdom had begun. It compassed all the lands<br />

Alas for the world&#8217;s reason, for Thy Son&#8217;s sane creed<br />
Of doing only good each day to its own need,<br />
Of being as the least of these in wise humility!<br />
Behold our Christian Saints, too proud to live or die<br />
As all flesh dies and lives, their emperors and kings<br />
Clothed in the robes of life as with an eagle&#8217;s wings,<br />
Their Popes dispensing power, their priests absolving sin.<br />
Nay. They have made a hell their damned shall dwell within,<br />

By reason of my pride. Thou wouldst have service done<br />
Unreasoning, on the knees, as flowers bend to the Sun,<br />

Who needed none to urge. His savage simian blood<br />
Flamed at a word, a sign. He lied, he thieved, he slew,<br />

Its countervice and foil, without my wit to aid.<br />
No fair thought but he chose the foul thought in its stead.<br />
Ah sad prim&aelig;val race! Thou saidst it was not Man<br />
This thing armed with the stone which through thy forests ran,<br />
Intent to snare and slay. Not Man the senseless knave<br />
Who struck fire from his flint to burn Thy gorses brave,<br />
Thy heaths for his lean kine, who, being the one unclean,<br />
Defiled thy flower-sweet Earth with ordure heaps obscene<br />
To plant his rice, his rye. Not Man, saidst Thou, because<br />
He knew not of Thy way nor had he learned Thy laws,<br />
And was stark savage still. Not Man? Behold to-day<br />
Thy tamed Man as he lives, Thy Son of Japhet, nay<br />
Thy new true-Christened King, the follower of Thy Christ,<br />
Who sweareth by Thy name and his own mail&eacute;d fist<br />

Heaven&#8217;s instrument ordained to teach integrity.<br />
Thinkest Thou the <i>man</i> is changed, the <i>ape</i> that in him is<br />

Are his lusts bridled more because his parts are hid?<br />
Nay, Lord, he doeth to-day as those forefathers did,<br />
Only in greater guile. I will tell Thee his full worth,<br />
This Man&#8217;s, the latest born, Thy creature from his birth<br />
Who lords it now, a king, this white Man&#8217;s who hath pressed<br />

Clothed in his robes of power. Whence was he? What is he<br />
That he asserteth thus his hand&#8217;s supremacy?<br />
His lineage what? Nay, Lord, he cometh of that mad stem<br />
Harder in act than Ham&#8217;s, more subtle than of Shem,<br />
The red Japhetic stock of the bare plains which rolled<br />
A base born horde on Rome erewhile in lust of gold,<br />
Tide following tide, the Goth, Gaul, Vandal, Lombard, Hun,<br />
Spewed forth from the white North to new dominion<br />
In the fair southern lands, with famine at their heel<br />
And rapine in their van, armed to the lips with steel.<br />

Her long renown, her skill, her art, her cultured fame,<br />
And with the rest her faiths bearing the Christian name.<br />
From this wild bitter root of violent lust and greed<br />

Pagan in spite of Christ, for the old gods cast down<br />

They see his long success, his victory over good,<br />
They count the nations lost which were of kindlier blood<br />
But could not stand before him, his great subtlety,<br />
His skill in the arts, the crafts. They mark the powers that be<br />
In earth, air, water, fire, all banded in his plan<br />
And used to the world&#8217;s hurt as never yet by Man.<br />
They look on Thee, Lord God, as one that careth not,<br />

Nor Thy name vainly taketh in the ways of folly,<br />
Hath a wise polity&mdash;his Church and State close blent,<br />
A lordly bench of bishops, peers of Parliament,<br />
A Convocation House which yearly witnesseth<br />
A king by grace of God, Defender of the Faith,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Thy ten commandments set in all his Courts of Law.<br />
They show his fanes restored by highway, hedge and shaw,<br />
His missions to the Jews, his Church societies,<br />
The zeal of his free sects, each than the rest more wise,<br />
The wealth of his chief priests, his weekly public prayer,<br />
Things proving him devout more than the nations are.<br />
They cite his worldly worth, his virtue these beyond,<br />
His high repute in trade, his word held as his bond,<br />
The valour of his dealings, his long boast of truth,<br />
The prudent continence of his unwedded youth,<br />
Uxorious faith in marriage, husband of one wife,<br />
Nor taking her next sister to his widowed life.<br />
These tales they hear and bring, some true, some false, but all<br />
Of the common Saxon brag for first original.<br />
So too of his world-science, social schemes, reforms,<br />
His school-boards, gaols new systemed, signalling of storms,<br />
Posts, railways, Homes for orphans, Charities organised,<br />
His Mansion House funds floated, alms economised,<br />
His hospitals, museums, baths, parks, workhouses,<br />
And that last glorious marvel, his free Daily Press.<br />
A wonderful Saxon truly, each day interviewed<br />
By his own wondering self and found exceeding good.<br />
All this and more they cite. That he hath virtues, well,<br />
Let it be granted him. Those pay who most would sell,<br />

In his account with time, and add strength to his hand,<br />
Serving his best advantage in the enlarged domain<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Of his Man&#8217;s selfishness, which works for the World&#8217;s bane<br />
More surely than his vices. He hath outlived the day<br />
Of the old single graspings, where each went his way<br />
Alone to plunder all. He hath learned to curb his lusts<br />
Somewhat, to smooth his brawls, to guide his passionate gusts<br />
His cry of &#8220;mine, mine, mine&#8221; in inarticulate wrath.<br />
He dareth not make raid on goods his next friend hath<br />
With open violence, nor loose his hand to steal,<br />
Save in community and for the common weal<br />
&#8217;Twixt Saxon man and man. He is more congruous grown,<br />
Holding a subtler plan to make the world his own<br />
By organised self-seeking in the paths of power.<br />
He is new drilled to wait. He knoweth his appointed hour<br />
And his appointed prey. Of all he maketh tool,<br />
Even of his own sad virtues, to cajole and rule,<br />

Sages, kings, poets, priests, in their hearts one and all&mdash;<br />

In face of Thy high fires each day beneath the sun&mdash;<br />
Ay, and their prelates too, their men of godliest worth,<br />

Controller of their acts, no word of Thy high right,<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>No word of Thy true law, the enforcement of Thy peace,<br />
Thy all-deciding arm in the world&#8217;s policies.<br />
They ignore Thee on the Earth. They grant Thee, as their &#8220;God,&#8221;<br />
The kingdom of the heavens, seeing it a realm untrod,<br />
Untreadable by man, a space, a <i>res nullius</i><br />
Or No-Man&#8217;s Land, which they as loyal men and pious<br />
Leave and assign to Thee to deal with as Thou wilt,<br />
To hold as Thy strong throne or loose as water spilt,<br />
For sun and wind to gather in the wastes of air.<br />
Whether of a truth Thou <i>art</i> they know not, Lord, nor care;<br />
Only they name Thee &#8220;God,&#8221; and pay Thee their prayers vain,<br />
As dormant over-lord and pensioned suzerain,<br />
The mediatised blind monarch of a world, outgrown<br />
Of its faith&#8217;s swaddling clothes, which wills to walk alone.<br />
The Earth not so. &#8217;Tis theirs, the prize of the strong hand,<br />
The strongest being their own by sea alike and land.<br />
&#8220;Thy Will be done,&#8221; they cry, &#8220;Father which art in Heaven,&#8221;<br />
(Where Thou canst harm nor hurt not one day in the seven.)<br />
And if they add &#8220;on Earth&#8221; they deem Thee impotent,<br />
Seeing Thee drowse thus long and leave men to their bent.<br />

So think their chiefs, their lords. For the blind mass of men,<br />
Which live and toil and die heart-hungry in their pen,<br />

And gold&#8217;s slave, drink, that buys a night&#8217;s forgetfulness.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Of Thee they have no heed to chide them or to cheer,<br />
The fear of Thee with these is their law&#8217;s officer.<br />
Lord God, if Thou but saw the pagan hearts they hide,<br />
The base greeds of their being, the lusts undenied,<br />
The Mammons that they worship! But Thou dost not see,<br />
Or Thou hadst purged long since this worst profanity<br />
From the World&#8217;s better way and thereby saved Thy name<br />
Profaned in their foul mouths from its long daily shame.<br />
Thou dost not hear, nor see. The smoke of their foul dens<br />
Broodeth on Thy fair Earth as a black pestilence,<br />
Hiding the kind day&#8217;s eye. No flower, no grass there groweth,<br />
Only their engines&#8217; dung which the fierce furnace throweth.<br />
Their presence poisoneth all and maketh all unclean.<br />
Thy streams they have made sewers for their dyes aniline.<br />
No fish therein may swim, no frog, no worm may crawl,<br />
No snail for grime may build her house within their wall.<br />
Thy beasts they have enslaved in blindness underground.<br />
The voice of birds that sang to them is a lost sound.<br />
Nay, they have tarred Time&#8217;s features, pock-marked Nature&#8217;s face,<br />
Brought all to the same jakes with their own lack of grace.<br />

The poorest saddest drudge, the least joy-lifted heart<br />

That he should stand, Thy choice, to preach Thy law, and set<br />
His impress on the Earth in full apostolate,<br />
Thy missioner and priest. He goeth among the nations,<br />
Saith he, to spread Thy truth, to preach Thy law of patience,<br />
To glorify Thy name! Not selfishly, forsooth,<br />
But for their own more good, to open them the truth,<br />
To teach them happiness, to civilise, to save,<br />
To smite down the oppressor and make free the slave.<br />
To bear the &#8220;White Man&#8217;s Burden,&#8221; which he yearns to take<br />
On his white Saxon back for his white conscience sake.<br />
Huge impudent imposture!&mdash;Lord, there were fair lands<br />
Once on Thy Earth, brave hills, bright isles, sweet coral strands,<br />
Noble savannahs, plains of limitless waving green,<br />
Lakes girt with giant forests, continents unseen,<br />
Unknown by these white thieves, where men lived in the way<br />
Of Thy good natural law with Thy free beasts at play<br />
And partners with Thy birds, men who nor toiled nor span,<br />
Nor sowed, nor reaped, nor delved for the red curse of Man,<br />
The gold that kills the soul, who knew nought of the fire<br />
Which in his guns he storeth, naught of the desire<br />
More deadly still concealed in his fire drink of death;<br />
Who went unclothed, unshamed, for garment a flower wreath;<br />
Whose women lived unsold and loved their natural kin,<br />
Nor gave aught to the stranger in the wage of sin;<br />
Who blessed Thee for their babes and through the woods, like Eve,<br />
Wandered in happy laughter, glorying to conceive.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Yea, Lord, and there were others,&mdash;shut communities<br />
Of souls still on Thy path and strange to the new lies,<br />
Yet, not as these were, wild, but held in discipline<br />
Of orderly commandment, servants true of Thine<br />
And doers of Thy law, but ignorant, untaught<br />
Save by an inward grace of self-restraining thought<br />
And light intuitive. No shedders they of blood,<br />
But with all creatures friends, with men in brotherhood,<br />
Blameless of wine, of strife. In innocent arts well skilled<br />
But schoolless of all guile as an unchristened child.<br />
To these with mouthings fine come the white gospellers,<br />
Our Saxon mission-men black coated to the ears.<br />

In the five Continents, the new world and the old.<br />
The happier tribes of Man despoiled, enslaved, betrayed<br />
To the sole white Man&#8217;s lust, husband and wife and maid.<br />
Their laughter drowned in tears, their kindness in mad wrath,<br />
Their dignity of joy in a foul trance of death,<br />
Till at the last they turn and in their anguish rend.<br />
Then loud the cry goeth forth, the white man&#8217;s to each friend:<br />
&#8220;Help! Christians, to our help! These black fiends murder us.&#8221;<br />
And the last scene is played in death&#8217;s red charnel house.<br />
The Saxon anger flames. His ships in armament<br />
Bear slaughter on their wings. The Earth with fire is rent,<br />
And the poor souls misused are wiped from the world&#8217;s face<br />
In one huge imprecation from the Saxon race,<br />
In one huge burst of prayer and insolent praise to Thee,<br />
Lord God, for Thy high help and proved complicity.<br />
Nay Lord, &#8217;tis not a lie, the thing I tell Thee thus.<br />
Their bishops in their Churches lead, incredulous,<br />
The public thanks profane. They sanctify the sword&mdash;<br />
&#8220;Te Deum laudamus. Give peace in our time, O Lord.&#8221;<br />
Hast Thou not heard their chanting? Nay, Thou dost not hear,<br />
Or Thou hadst loosed Thy hand like lightning in the clear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>To smite their ribald lips with palsy, these false priests,<br />
These Lords who boast Thine aid at their high civic feasts,<br />
The ignoble shouting crowds, the prophets of their Press,<br />
Pouring their daily flood of bald self-righteousness,<br />
Their poets who write big of the &#8220;White Burden.&#8221; Trash!<br />
The White Man&#8217;s Burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash.<br />
&mdash;There. Thou hast heard the truth. Thy world, Lord God of Heaven,<br />
Lieth in the hands of thieves who pillage morn and even.<br />
And Thou still sleepest on! Nay but Thou needs must hear<br />
Or abdicate Thy name of High Justiciar<br />
Henceforward and for ever. It o&#8217;erwhelmeth Thee<br />
With more than temporal shame. Thy silence is a Sea<br />
Crying through all the spheres in pain and ceasing not<br />
As blood from out the ground to mark crime&#8217;s murder spot:<br />
&#8220;There is no hope&mdash;no truth. He hath betrayed the trust.<br />
&#8220;The Lord God is unjust. The Lord God is unjust.&#8221; (<i>A cry without.</i>)<br />
This is their cry in Heaven who give Thee service true.<br />
Arise, Lord, and avenge as was Thy wont to do.</td></tr>

Thy Earth is a lost force, Man&#8217;s lazar-house of woe,<br />
Undone by his lewd will. We may no longer strive.<br />
The evil hath prevailed. There is no soul alive<br />
That shall escape his greed. We spend our days in tears<br />
Mourning Thy world&#8217;s lost beauty in the night of years.<br />
All pity is departed. Each once happy thing<br />
That on Thy fair Earth went, how fleet of foot or wing,<br />
How glorious in its strength, how wondrous in design,<br />
How royal in its raiment tinctured opaline,<br />
How rich in joyous life, the inheritor of forms<br />
All noble, all of worth, which had survived the storms,<br />
The chances of decay in the World&#8217;s living plan,<br />
From the remote fair past when still ignoble Man<br />
On his four foot-soles went and howled through the lone hills<br />
In moody bestial wrath, unclassed among Earth&#8217;s ills&mdash;<br />
Each one of them is doomed. From the deep Central Seas<br />
To the white Poles, Man ruleth pitiless Lord of these,<br />
And daily he destroyeth. The great whales he driveth<br />
Beneath the northern ice, and quarter none he giveth,<br />
Who perish there of wounds in their huge agony.<br />
He presseth the white bear on the white frozen sea<br />
And slaughtereth for his pastime. The wise amorous seal<br />
He flayeth big with young, the walrus cubs that kneel<br />
But cannot turn his rage, alive he mangleth them,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Leaveth in breathing heaps, outrooted branch and stem.<br />
In every land he slayeth. He hath new engines made<br />
Which no life may withstand, nor in the forest shade<br />
Nor in the sunlit plain, which wound all from afar,<br />
The timorous with the valiant, waging his false war,<br />
Coward, himself unseen. In pity, Lord, look down<br />
On the blank widowed plains which he hath made his own<br />
By right of solitude. Where, Lord God, are they now,<br />
Thy glorious bison herds, Thy ariels white as snow,<br />
Thy antelopes in troops, the zebras of Thy plain?<br />
Behold their whitened bones on the dull track of men.<br />
Thy elephants, Lord, where? For ages thou didst build<br />
Their frames&#8217; capacity, the hide which was their shield<br />
No thorn might pierce, no sting, no violent tooth assail,<br />
The tusks which were their levers, the lithe trunk their flail.<br />
Thou strengthenedst their deep brain. Thou madest them wise to know<br />
And wiser to ignore, advised, deliberate, slow,<br />
Conscious of power supreme in right. The manifest token<br />
Of Thy high will on earth, Thy natural peace unbroken,<br />
Unbreakable by fear. For ages did they move<br />
Thus, kings of Thy deep forest swayed by only love.<br />
Where are they now, Lord God? A fugitive spent few<br />
Used as Man&#8217;s living targets by the ignoble crew<br />
Who boast their coward skill to plant the balls that fly.<br />
Thy work of all time spoiled, their only use to die<br />
That these sad clowns may laugh. Nay, Lord, we weep for <i>Thee</i>,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>And spend ourselves in tears for Thy marred majesty.<br />
Behold, Lord, what we bring&mdash;this last proof in our hands,<br />
Their latest fiendliest spoil from Thy fair tropic lands,<br />
The birds of all the Earth unwinged to deck the heads<br />
Of their unseemly women; plumage of such reds<br />
As not the sunset hath, such purples as no throne,<br />
Not even in heaven, showeth,&mdash;hardly, Lord, Thine own;<br />
Such azures as the sea&#8217;s, such greens as are in Spring<br />
The oak trees&#8217; tenderest buds of watched-for blossoming,<br />
Such opalescent pearls as only in Thy skies<br />
The lunar bow revealeth to night&#8217;s sleep-tired eyes.<br />
Behold them, Lord of Beauty, Lord of Reverence,<br />
Lord of Compassion, Thou who meetest means to ends,<br />
Nor madest Thy world fair for less than Thine own fame,<br />
Behold Thy birds of joy lost, tortured, put to shame<br />
For these vile strumpets&#8217; whim. Arise, or cease to be<br />
Judge of the quick and dead! These dead wings cry to Thee!<br />
Arise, Lord, and avenge!</td></tr>

Winds with his counter-winds. He liveth on foul air<br />

For Thy worst lightning strokes, holding their principle<br />
Rock-firm in his own hand. All natural powers fulfil<br />
His brain&#8217;s omnipotence. He standeth at each point<br />
Armed for defiant war in harness without joint.<br />
Though Thou shouldst break the Earth in twain he should not bend.<br />

A principle of good which shall outwit his guile<br />
